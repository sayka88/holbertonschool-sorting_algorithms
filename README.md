## Objective

Learn:

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Description

This project is meant to help us understant how to implement sorting algorithms and understanding Big O notation

## Requirements

-   Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- 	All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
-	All your files should end with a new line
-	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-	Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
-	You are not allowed to use global variables
-	No more than 5 functions per file
-	Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, â€¦ is totally forbidden.
-	In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
-	The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
-	Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
-	All your header files should be include guarded
-	A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

## Mandatory Tasks

### Task 0. Bubble sort 

### Task 1. Insertion sort 

### Task 2. Selection sort 

### Task 3. Quick sort
